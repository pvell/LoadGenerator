This feature allows authorized users to create custom surveillance rules on the fly, providing flexibility to adapt to evolving market conditions and emerging threats. Users can define rule parameters such as price, volume, reference data, and arithmetic operations (e.g., greater than, less than, equal to) to set dynamic thresholds for alert generation.

Required Information:

User-defined parameters for rule creation
Arithmetic operations for threshold setting
Threshold values for alert triggering








5.6		Multi-Order Spoofing with Bait and Switch

Objective:
Detect participants entering and deleting large orders that add liquidity to the order book for a short period, followed by a profitable trade on the opposite side.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Number of entered and deleted orders
Lifespan of the orders
Details of the profitable trade

5.7		Spoofing - Rapid Entry and Delete
