1	Executive Summary

The Surveillance System aims to monitor trading activity from the trading system to identify potential market abuse and irregularities. This document outlines the business requirements for the system, including specific alert scenarios for equities and options markers and their expected outputs.

2	Introduction

The Surveillance System will generate alerts based on predefined criteria to detect abnormal trading patterns, repeated orders, and other potential market abuses. The alerts will assist in maintaining a fair and transparent market environment.

Trading activity is monitored by utilizing DeepHaven as the primary repository for trading data. Algorithms are executed within DeepHaven to generate alerts, and these alerts are inserted into a Postgres database. The UI interfaces with the PostgresDB to present and manage the alerts.


3	Objectives

The primary objectives of the Market Surveillance System are:

•	Identify and generate alerts for potential market abuse.
•	Provide detailed information and analysis for each alert scenario.
•	Facilitate timely intervention and investigation by relevant authorities.

4	Scope

The surveillance system will focus on monitoring trade and order data from the trading system. It covers specific alert scenarios such as high order to trade ratio, repeat orders, capping and pegging, phishing, pinging orders, wash sales, spoofing, rapid entry and delete, and large trades.

5	Stakeholders

Stakeholders involved in the Market Surveillance System include:

Regulatory Team
[TBD]

8	User Interface

The user interface (UI) is designed to provide comprehensive functionality to the regulatory team, to efficiently manage and oversee the surveillance process. 

8.1	Audit Trail

•	[8.1.1] The UI includes a robust audit trail functionality, ensuring transparency and accountability in the surveillance activities.
•	[8.1.2] Every action taken within the system, such as alert configuration changes, acknowledgment of alerts, and interventions, is logged with a timestamp.
•	[8.1.3] The audit trail serves as a detailed record of user interactions, providing a transparent view of system activities for compliance and auditing purposes.

8.2	Alert Configuration

•	[8.2.1] Regulatory users have the capability to configure alert parameters and criteria directly from the user interface.
•	[8.2.2] This flexibility allows the regulatory team to adapt surveillance strategies to evolving market conditions or regulatory requirements without requiring extensive technical expertise.

8.3	Alert Acknowledgment and Action

The UI enables regulatory users to acknowledge alerts and take necessary actions promptly.
Upon receiving an alert, the regulatory team can acknowledge it directly from the UI, indicating awareness and initiating further investigation or intervention.

8.4	User Roles and Permissions

•	[8.4.1] The UI incorporates a role-based access control system, ensuring that regulatory team members have access to functionalities relevant to their responsibilities.
•	[8.4.2] This role-based approach enhances security and streamlines workflow, allowing regulatory users to focus on their specific tasks within the surveillance process.

8.5	Dashboards and Reporting:

•	[8.5.1] The UI features a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of the current surveillance status, including the number and status of alerts, recent system activities, and pending actions.
•	[8.5.2] Regulatory users can generate customizable reports from the UI, facilitating data-driven decision-making and regulatory compliance reporting.


9	Benchmarking

Benchmarking is a dynamic and essential component of Surveillance System, enabling it to adapt to changing market conditions and ensuring the timely identification of suspicious activities. It involves the establishment of threshold values for various parameters by analyzing historical data using statistical methods. The primary goal of benchmarking is to identify fair benchmarks to surveil trading system.

The system employs several benchmarking methods, including Standard Deviation, Distribution Cut-off, and Threshold Table, to determine thresholds for issuing alerts.

•	[9.1] Benchmark parameters are periodically updated in the system's database.
•	[9.2] Alert thresholds are calculated based on the selected benchmarking method for each specific alert type.
•	[9.3] Calculated thresholds are then used to trigger alerts for potential market abuse or irregularities in real-time.



10	Non-functional Requirements

The surveillance system should process alerts in real-time with minimal latency.
The system should be scalable to accommodate growing trade and order data.
Data confidentiality and integrity should be maintained.



11	Assumptions and Dependencies

The trading system provides accurate and timely trade and order data.
The surveillance system has access to necessary historical data for analysis.


12	Constraints

The system's performance may be impacted by fluctuations in trade and order volume.
