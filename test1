The surveillance system will serve as a direct replacement for the existing SMARTS (Surveillance, Monitoring, and Analysis Real-Time Systems) platform, providing an equivalent set of functionalities without introducing any new features. The transition from SMARTS to the new system aims to maintain continuity in monitoring trade and order data from the trading system.
