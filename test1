8	User Interface

The user interface (UI) is designed to provide comprehensive functionality to the regulatory team, to efficiently manage and oversee the surveillance process. 

8.1	Audit Trail

•	[8.1.1] The UI includes a robust audit trail functionality, ensuring transparency and accountability in the surveillance activities.
•	[8.1.2] Every action taken within the system, such as alert configuration changes, acknowledgment of alerts, and interventions, is logged with a timestamp.
•	[8.1.3] The audit trail serves as a detailed record of user interactions, providing a transparent view of system activities for compliance and auditing purposes.

8.2	Alert Configuration

•	[8.2.1] Regulatory users have the capability to configure specific alert parameters directly from the user interface.
•	[8.2.2] The alert configuration section allows the definition of a generic alert with customizable parameters.

    **Generic Alert Configuration:**
    
    [8.2.2.1] Security Identifier: Users can specify the security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol) for the alert.
    
    [8.2.2.2] Firm Identifier: Users can define a firm identifier for targeted surveillance on specific firms or participants.
    
    [8.2.2.3] Price Condition: Users can set conditions based on the price field, using arithmetic operations (e.g., >, <, =).
    
    [8.2.2.4] Volume Condition: Users can set conditions based on the volume field, using arithmetic operations (e.g., >, <, =).
    
    [8.2.2.5] Time Interval: Users can define a time interval for the alert, specifying the duration over which the conditions should be evaluated.
    
    [8.2.2.6] Arithmetic Operations: Users can apply arithmetic operations on price, volume, and time interval fields to create complex alert conditions.
    
    [8.2.2.7] Save and Apply: The UI allows users to save and apply the configured generic alert for ongoing surveillance.

8.3	Alert Acknowledgment and Action

The UI enables regulatory users to acknowledge alerts and take necessary actions promptly.
