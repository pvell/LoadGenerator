1.	Executive Summary

The Market Surveillance System aims to monitor trade and order data from the trading system to identify potential market abuse and irregularities. This document outlines the business requirements for the system, including specific alert scenarios, expected outputs, and testing procedures.

2.	Introduction

The surveillance system will generate alerts based on predefined criteria to detect abnormal trading patterns, repeated orders, and other potential market abuses. The alerts will assist in maintaining a fair and transparent market environment.


3.	Objectives

The primary objectives of the Market Surveillance System are:

•	Identify and generate alerts for potential market abuse.
•	Provide detailed information and analysis for each alert scenario.
•	Facilitate timely intervention and investigation by relevant authorities.

4.	Scope

The surveillance system will focus on monitoring trade and order data from the trading system. It covers specific alert scenarios such as high order to trade ratio, repeat orders, capping and pegging, phishing, pinging orders, wash sales, spoofing, rapid entry and delete, and large trades.

5.	Stakeholders

Stakeholders involved in the Trade and Order Surveillance System include:

Regulatory Team
Trading system Dev



6.	Functional Requirements - Options
