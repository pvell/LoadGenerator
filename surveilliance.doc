1. Executive Summary
The Market Surveillance System aims to monitor trade and order data from the trading system to identify potential market abuse and irregularities. This document outlines the business requirements for the system, including specific alert scenarios, expected outputs, and testing procedures.

2. Introduction
The surveillance system will generate alerts based on predefined criteria to detect abnormal trading patterns, repeated orders, and other potential market abuses. The alerts will assist in maintaining a fair and transparent market environment.


3. Objectives
The primary objectives of the Market Surveillance System are:

•	Identify and generate alerts for potential market abuse.
•	Provide detailed information and analysis for each alert scenario.
•	Facilitate timely intervention and investigation by relevant authorities.

4. Scope
The surveillance system will focus on monitoring trade and order data from the trading system. It covers specific alert scenarios such as high order to trade ratio, repeat orders, capping and pegging, phishing, pinging orders, wash sales, spoofing, rapid entry and delete, and large trades.

5. Stakeholders
Stakeholders involved in the Trade and Order Surveillance System include:

Regulatory authorities
Compliance officers
Trading system Dev
Market participants


6. Functional Requirements


Alert 7075: High Order To Trade Rate
Objective:
Detect abnormal order-to-trade ratios, which may indicate potential market abuse, including High-Frequency Trading (HFT), quote stuffing, or attempts to create a false market.

Description:
This alert triggers when the order-to-trade ratio exceeds a defined threshold, indicating an unusual concentration of orders relative to executed trades. This could signify disruptive trading practices, such as market manipulation or false market creation.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Number of orders and trades
Order-to-trade ratio
Threshold for order-to-trade ratio
Relevant system parameters (e.g., default order-to-trade ratio)

Alert 7022: Repeat Orders
Objective:
Identify repeated entry of large orders by the same broker with the same price and volume, suggesting potential system errors or attempts to manipulate the order book.

Description:
This alert triggers when a broker repeatedly enters orders with the same price and volume, potentially indicating a malfunctioning order entry system or intentional manipulation.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Number of orders and trades
Total consideration of the orders
Minimum number of orders triggering the alert
Price and volume of the repeated orders
Minimum interval for retriggering the alert
Alert 6070: Capping And Pegging
Objective:
Identify participants with significant positions in futures or options contracts dominating trading in the underlying security before settlement.

Description:
This alert triggers when a participant holds a large position in a futures or options contract, potentially influencing the underlying security's trading before the settlement price is set.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Participant's position in futures/options contracts
Relevant settlement-related parameters
Intensity level for the alert
Alert 4071: Phishing
Objective:
Identify participants engaging in "pinging" the market with small orders to detect hidden volume and execute transactions with relatively large volume.

Description:
This alert triggers when a participant places small orders to detect hidden volume, followed by a large trade against the identified price, potentially indicating an attempt to exploit hidden liquidity.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Number of pinging orders
Best ask price detected
Volume and price of the subsequent large trade
Minimum ping order count triggering the alert
Alert 4041: Wash Sales A to B to A
Objective:
Identify wash sales, where a participant buys and sells the same volume of shares with another participant, potentially to manipulate or create misleading trading activity.

Description:
This alert triggers when a participant buys from another and then sells the same volume back, potentially indicating a wash sale. The alert distinguishes between normal and money passing wash sales.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Involved brokers, traders, and clients
Price, volume, and total value of the transactions
Indication of normal or money passing wash sale
Alert 4032: MULTI-ORDER SPOOFING WITH BAIT AND SWITCH
Objective:
Detect participants entering and deleting large orders that add liquidity to the order book for a short period, followed by a profitable trade on the opposite side.

Description:
This alert triggers when a participant enters and deletes a number of large orders, contributing to order book liquidity for a short time, and subsequently executes a profitable trade on the opposite side.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Number of entered and deleted orders
Lifespan of the orders
Details of the profitable trade
Alert 4020: SPOOFING - RAPID ENTRY AND DELETE
Objective:
Identify brokers entering and deleting a large number of unexecuted orders within a short time, suggesting potential spoofing.

Description:
This alert triggers when a broker rapidly enters and deletes a significant number of unexecuted orders within a short period, potentially indicating spoofing behavior.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Number of entered and deleted orders
Timeframe for order existence
Minimum genuine trade value and estimated profit thresholds
Alert 4026: ORDER WITHDRAWAL (CONTINUOUS)
Objective:
Identify the entry and deletion of large orders at the best bid or ask price, deleted before any executions, potentially indicating continuous attempts to game the market.

Description:
This alert triggers when a participant enters and deletes a large order at the best bid or ask price, with no executions, suggesting possible attempts to manipulate the market through continuous order withdrawal.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the event
Order details (price, volume, etc.)
Maximum allowed alive time for an order
Threshold for considering the number of deleted orders excessive
Alert 2031: Large trade
Objective:
Identify significantly large trades in an instrument, considering benchmarks, absolute value, and volume, to detect potential market impact.

Description:
This alert triggers when a trade's volume and value exceed predefined thresholds, indicating a significantly large transaction that may impact the market.

Required Information:

Security identifier (e.g., ticker symbol)
Timestamp of the trade
Trade volume and value
Benchmark information
User-defined thresholds for large trade volume and value
Alertserver Date: [Date]
Test Case Description: Verify alert triggers when the order's volume is larger than LARGE TRADE VOLUME 2031 and the order's value is larger than LARGE TRADE VALUE 2031.
Expected output: [Expected output details]
7. Non-functional Requirements
The surveillance system should process alerts in real-time with minimal latency.
The system should be scalable to accommodate growing trade and order data.
Data confidentiality and integrity should be maintained.
8. Assumptions and Dependencies
The trading system provides accurate and timely trade and order data.
The surveillance system has access to necessary historical data for analysis.
9. Constraints
The system's performance may be impacted by fluctuations in trade and order volume.
Regulatory changes may necessitate updates to alert criteria.
10. Risks
Inadequate data quality may lead to false alerts.
Changes in market dynamics may require continuous refinement of alert criteria.
11. Sign-Off
