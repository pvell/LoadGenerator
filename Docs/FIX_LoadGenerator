FIX Load Generator
The FIX Load Generator is a Python script that generates and sends FIX messages to a target FIX server. It can be used for testing and benchmarking purposes, simulating high message load scenarios.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or above
QuickFIX library

Installation
Clone the repository or download the fix_load_generator.py script.

Install the QuickFIX library by following the official installation instructions: QuickFIX Installation

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:


pip install requirements.txt

Configuration
Create a configuration file config.ini to specify the generator settings.

Define the following parameters in the config.ini file:

template_file: Path to the FIX message template file.
connection_config_file: Path to the QuickFIX connection configuration file.
log_file: Path to the log file where received messages will be written.
message_rate: Rate at which messages will be sent (messages per second).
send_duration: Duration in seconds for which messages will be sent.
Customize the message weights for different message types in the [MessageTypes] section of the config.ini file. Each message type should be specified as a key-value pair, where the key is the message type and the value is the weight of that message type.

Usage
Ensure that the FIX ports are running and reachable.

Run the fix_load_generator.py script using the following command:

python fix_load_generator.py

The load generator will establish a connection to the FIX port and start sending messages according to the specified configuration.

The script will output logs and status information to the console.
