Overview
The MEMO FIX for Options protocol is the application layer message standard used by members to submit orders to the Options Exchange. MEMO FIX is a text key=value formatted protocol based on the FIX Trading Community FIX 5.0 SP2 specifications.
Architecture
Transport Layer
The MEMO FIX for Options protocol uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to provide reliable and ordered delivery of messages between clients and MEMO servers.
Session Layer
The MEMO FIX for Options protocol uses the FIXT 1.1 specification session messages to establish and maintain a session.
Application Layer
MEMO FIX for Options protocol application layer messages are based on the Financial Information Exchange (FIX) Protocol version 5.0 and are key=value text encoded.
ClOrdID
All ClOrdIDs can be up to 20 characters. They can contain only ASCII printable characters.
Symbology
Upon request via a separate channel, the exchange provides a list of instrument directory messages. Each instrument directory message provides these important fields used to identify a product for order processing:
•	OptionsSecurityID (custom tag 21035), an 8 CHAR field that uniquely identifies an options security on the exchange,
•	Symbol (tag 55, OSIRoot), the OSI Root for the options security,
•	MaturityDate, the date of maturity (a full date) of the Local Market (vs. UTC) in YYYYMMDD format,
•	PutOrCall, indicates if the option security is a Put or a Call,
•	StrikePrice, the strike price for the option security.
The MEMO for Options FIX protocol allows the use of the OptionsSecurityID (custom tag 21035), or the combination of the Symbol (tag 55, OSIRoot), MaturityDate (tag 541), the PutOrCall (tag 201) and the StrikePrice (tags 202) to identify an option security.
Message Field Types
AllocTransType (FIX tag 71)
The AllocTransType Identifies an allocation transaction type.
AllocTransType is encoded as an int type.
Value	Name	Description
0	New	Replace existing trade with allocation. This is the first allocation on a trade and clients should reference ExecID when submitting.
1	Replace	Replacing existing allocations with new allocations. This is any subsequent allocation and clients should use tag 72 to match a previously reported tag 755 from an AllocationReport message.

Identifies the reason why an order cancellation or replace request was rejected.
Values 0-99 are reserved by the FIX specification. Note that not all of the reserved FIX codes are used.
Values 100-199 are used to denote issues with specific request fields.

Session Management
The client establishes a session by opening a TCP connection to an exchange MEMO FIX for Options port, (server) and sending a FIX logon message with the appropriate credentials and MsgSeqNum set. Values for SenderCompID and TargetCompID will be provisioned by the exchange and will be verified by the server upon receipt of the Logon message. If the Logon message is accepted, the server will send a Logon response. If the MsgSeqNum on the inbound logon is less than expected by the server, the logon will be rejected.
If the MsgSeqNum on the inbound logon is greater than expected, the server will reply with a Logon and send a ResendRequest for the missing messages. The client application should gap fill any session level messages and may opt to resend any business level messages with the PossDup flag set (see FIXT 1.1 specification Message Recovery). For example, if a client opts to resend a stale NewOrderSingle during a gap fill, the server will process the message, and that order may become eligible for execution.
When the client application receives the Logon response it should compare the MsgSeqNum to the expected server sequence number. If a gap is detected, it should send a ResendRequest message to the server. The server will resend any missing business level messages with the PossDup flag set. Instead of resending session-level messages, the server will issue sequence reset messages with the GapFillFlag set.
If the connection to the MEMO FIX port is lost, and the “cancel on disconnect” feature is enabled for the port, the system will cancel all orders associated with that session. The Canceled execution reports generated by the “cancel on disconnect” event shall be stored by the server, and will be available for resending when the client re-establishes the session. If If the “cancel on disconnect” feature is not enabled for the port, then any orders that were active when the connection was closed shall be eligible for execution. By default, the “cancel on disconnect” feature is enabled. 
When the client terminates a session it should send a Logout message and wait for the Logout response from the server before closing the connection. This procedure facilitates gap detection and processing before the connection is closed.
At the end of a logical trading session, the FIX inbound and outbound sequence numbers are set to 1. All inbound FIX messages will be rejected if a FIX session has not been established. If the server receives a message with a MsgSeqNum less than the expected client sequence number, and that message does not have the PossDup flag set, the server will disconnect the client. In the event of a failover to a backup port, the backup port will maintain the sequence numbers of the primary, and it will have the ability to replay any messages that the primary port sent. 
The server will process any business level messages with the PossResend flag set. The server will reject any messages that it has already seen-- for example, NewOrderSingle or CancelReplace messages with duplicate ClOrdID.
