SBE Load Generator Documentation
Introduction
The SBE Load Generator is a tool designed to simulate and send various SBE (Simple Binary Encoding) messages to a trading system. It allows you to test the performance and resilience of your trading platform by generating a configurable load of SBE messages.

Prerequisites
Before using the SBE Load Generator, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Python: Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Configuration Files: Create configuration files config.ini and connections.cfg with appropriate settings. These files define parameters such as message rates, message types, and connection details.

Installation
Clone the SBE Load Generator repository from the GitHub repository link.

Install required Python packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install configparser sbe_encoder_decoder
Configuration
config.ini
The config.ini file contains various configuration settings for the SBE Load Generator. Key parameters include:

message_rate: The rate at which messages are generated and sent.
duration: The duration for which messages should be generated.
Weights: Weighted probabilities for different message types.
OptionsSecurityIDs: Mapping of underliers to their associated options security IDs.
connections.cfg
The connections.cfg file specifies the connection details for the trading sessions. Each section in this file represents a different trading session, with details like host, port, user, and password.

Usage
Start the SBE Load Generator by running the load_generator.py script:

Copy code
python load_generator.py
The generator will read the configuration files and initiate one or more trading sessions based on the settings in connections.cfg.

During the specified duration, the generator will send messages according to the configured message rates and types.

You can monitor the progress and output of each session in the console.

Message Types
The SBE Load Generator supports the following message types:

NewOrderSingle: Simulates new order placement.
NewOrderSingle_mkt: Simulates market orders.
ShortTwoSideBulkQuote: Simulates short two-sided bulk quotes.
LongTwoSideBulkQuote: Simulates long two-sided bulk quotes.
ShortOneSideBulkQuote: Simulates short one-sided bulk quotes.
LongOneSideBulkQuote: Simulates long one-sided bulk quotes.
Extending Message Types
You can extend the message types supported by the SBE Load Generator by modifying the code and adding new message generation functions.

Customization
You can customize various parameters such as message rates, duration, and message types by editing the config.ini file.

Error Handling
The SBE Load Generator includes basic error handling for login and session establishment. It will exit gracefully if login is rejected.

Conclusion
The SBE Load Generator is a versatile tool for stress testing trading systems and assessing their performance under load. It allows you to simulate different types of SBE messages and customize testing parameters.
