Strengths:

Cindy has good interpersonal skills and can bring people together to work in collaborative and cohesive work environment.

Setbacks

On the flip side, there were moments when Cindy dismissed the importance of "time to market," emphasizing her belief in following and implementing Scrum principles as the key to project success. Additionally, when asked about things that she would look at in identifying risks during project planning, she expressed the view that following the plan diligently would eliminate any risks. Given her background, not coming from finance or tech, it seems she might have a steep learning curve before becoming fully productive.
