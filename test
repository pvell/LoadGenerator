9. User Interface
The user interface (UI) is designed to provide comprehensive functionality to different user roles, including analysts, supervisors, and administrators, to efficiently manage and oversee the surveillance process.

9.1 Alerts Management View
Alerts Management View serves as a central hub for overseeing and addressing surveillance alerts efficiently.

Alert Display: All alerts are listed with unique IDs, associated workflows (such as open, in progress, resolved), timestamps indicating when the ticket was opened, and tracking by age to prioritize based on urgency.
Workflow Management: Alerts follow a workflow of statuses including open, in progress, and closed. Users can transition alerts through these statuses directly from the UI, ensuring timely handling and tracking of each alert.
Audit Trail for Alerts: A robust audit trail records every action taken on alerts, including configuration changes, acknowledgments, and interventions. Each entry is logged with a timestamp, providing transparency and accountability in alert management.
9.2 Case Management View
Case Management View facilitates the structured handling and resolution of alerts triggered by the surveillance system.

Alert Ticket Creation Workflow: Automatic case creation upon alert generation, integration of alert details into the case, and provision for user input to provide context for investigation.
Matter Creation and Association: Users can create regulatory matters within the system and associate them with multiple alerts. Matters serve as overarching entities to manage related alerts and have their own workflow for tracking and resolution.
Case Ticket Fields: Essential fields such as status, assigned to, severity, and matter ID categorize and prioritize cases effectively.
Case Management UI Features: List view for easy access to open and closed cases, filtering and sorting options for quick identification, workflow actions for status updates and escalations, seamless integration with the alert system and matter management, and reporting capabilities for compliance and analysis.
Workflow for Case Management: Cases follow a workflow of statuses including open, in progress, supervisor review, and closed. This structured approach ensures that cases and associated matters are systematically reviewed and resolved, with opportunities for supervisor review to ensure quality and accuracy.
Audit Trail for Cases and Matters: Like alerts, all actions related to case and matter management, including status changes, resolutions, and updates, are logged in an audit trail. This comprehensive record ensures transparency and compliance with regulatory standards.
9.3 Custom Reports View
The Custom Reports View enables users to generate custom reports based on data stored in the system.

Report Generation: Built-in tools for generating custom reports, specifying parameters, filters, and formatting options tailored to user needs.
Data-driven Decision Making: Reports facilitate data-driven decision-making and regulatory compliance reporting.
Accessibility: Custom reports are accessible to authorized users based on their roles and permissions.
9.4 Role-Based Access Control
The UI incorporates a role-based access control system, ensuring that users have access to functionalities relevant to their responsibilities.

Analyst: Responsible for monitoring alerts, investigating cases, and generating reports.
Supervisor: Overseeing the surveillance process, managing cases, and ensuring the quality and accuracy of investigations.
Administrator: Responsible for system configuration, user management, and overall system maintenance.
9.5 Mockups
Mockups illustrating the UI design for Alerts Management, Case Management, Custom Reports, and Role-Based Access Control will be provided for stakeholder review and approval.
