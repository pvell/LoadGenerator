1	Executive Summary

The Surveillance System aims to monitor trading activity from the trading system to identify potential market abuse and irregularities. This document outlines the business requirements for the system, including specific alert scenarios for equities and options markers and their expected outputs.

2	Introduction

The Surveillance System will generate alerts based on predefined criteria to detect abnormal trading patterns, repeated orders, and other potential market abuses. The alerts will assist in maintaining a fair and transparent market environment.

Trading activity is monitored by utilizing data store as the primary repository for trading data. Algorithms are executed within data store to generate alerts, and these alerts are inserted into a Postgres database. The UI interfaces with the PostgresDB to present and manage the alerts.


3	Objectives

The primary objectives of the Market Surveillance System are:

•	Identify and generate alerts for potential market abuse.
•	Provide detailed information and analysis for each alert scenario.
•	Facilitate timely intervention and investigation by relevant authorities.

4	Scope


The surveillance system will serve as a direct replacement for the existing SMARTS (Surveillance, Monitoring, and Analysis Real-Time Systems) platform, providing an equivalent set of functionalities without introducing any new features. The transition from SMARTS to the new system aims to maintain continuity in monitoring trade and order data from the trading system.

•	[9.1.3] User Input: Users can input additional information related to the alert, providing context and insights for the investigation.

10.2	Case Ticket Fields

Each case ticket contains essential fields to manage and categorize the alert effectively.

    [9.2.1] Status: The current status of the case, indicating whether it is open, under investigation, resolved, or closed.

    [9.2.2] Assigned To: The team member or user responsible for investigating and resolving the case.

    [9.2.3] Severity: A classification of the severity level associated with the alert, helping prioritize investigations.

•	[9.5.2] Data Privacy: Case details are treated with confidentiality, and access is restricted to authorized personnel.



11	Benchmarking

Benchmarking is a dynamic and essential component of Surveillance System, enabling it to adapt to changing market conditions and ensuring the timely identification of suspicious activities. It involves the establishment of threshold values for various parameters by analyzing historical data using statistical methods. The primary goal of benchmarking is to identify fair benchmarks to surveil trading system.

The system employs several benchmarking methods, including Standard Deviation, Distribution Cut-off, and Threshold Table, to determine thresholds for issuing alerts.

•	[10.1] Benchmark parameters are periodically updated in the system's database.
•	[10.2] Alert thresholds are calculated based on the selected benchmarking method for each specific alert type.
•	[10.3] Calculated thresholds are then used to trigger alerts for potential market abuse or irregularities in real-time.



12	Non-functional Requirements

The surveillance system should process alerts in real-time with minimal latency.
The system should be scalable to accommodate growing trade and order data.
Data confidentiality and integrity should be maintained.



13	Assumptions and Dependencies

The trading system provides accurate and timely trade and order data.
The surveillance system has access to necessary historical data for analysis.


14	Constraints

The system's performance may be impacted by fluctuations in trade and order volume.
Regulatory changes may necessitate updates to alert criteria.



15	Risks

Inadequate data quality may lead to false alerts.
Changes in market dynamics may require continuous refinement of alert criteria.
