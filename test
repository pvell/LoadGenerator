Strengths:

Cindy has good interpersonal skills and can bring people together to work in collaborative and cohesive work environment.

Setbacks

On the flip side, there were moments when Cindy dismissed the importance of "time to market," emphasizing her belief in following and implementing Scrum principles as the key to project success. Additionally, when asked about things that she would look at in identifying risks during project planning, she expressed the view that following the plan diligently would eliminate any risks. Given her background, not coming from finance or tech, it seems she might have a steep learning curve before becoming fully productive.


Kyle:


Strengths:
Kyle's got a good mix of experience, having worked in both startups and big firms. This shows he's flexible and can handle different workplace settings. He talked about pulling off projects of all sizes, from the big enterprise stuff to smaller ones that last 2-3 sprints. He explained about various project planning tools that he used that would help in efficient planning/executions including jira/atlassian products. He spoke about how good stakeholder management, right prioritisation and timely tradeoff's would help him execute project successfully.

Setbacks:
Kyle lacks experience working in any regulatory environment but seemed like a quick learner.
