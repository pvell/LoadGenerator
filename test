1	Executive Summary

The Surveillance System aims to monitor trading activity from the trading system to identify potential market abuse and irregularities. This document outlines the business requirements for the system, including specific alert scenarios for equities and options markers and their expected outputs.

2	Introduction

The Surveillance System will generate alerts based on predefined criteria to detect abnormal trading patterns, repeated orders, and other potential market abuses. The alerts will assist in maintaining a fair and transparent market environment.

Trading activity is monitored by utilizing data store as the primary repository for trading data. Algorithms are executed within data store to generate alerts, and these alerts are inserted into a data store database. The UI interfaces with the Data Store to present and manage the alerts.


3	Objectives

The primary objectives of the Market Surveillance System are:

•	Identify and generate alerts for potential market abuse.
•	Provide detailed information and analysis for each alert scenario.
•	Facilitate timely intervention and investigation by relevant authorities.

4	Scope


The surveillance system will serve as a direct replacement for the existing SMARTS (Surveillance, Monitoring, and Analysis Real-Time Systems) platform, providing an equivalent set of functionalities without introducing any new features. The transition from SMARTS to the new system aims to maintain continuity in monitoring trade and order data from the trading system.

7	Functional Requirements – Custom Rule Creation

Objective:
Enable the creation of custom surveillance rules based on user-defined parameters and arithmetic operations to detect emerging market abuse patterns not covered by predefined alert scenarios.

Description:
This feature allows authorized users to create custom surveillance rules on the fly, providing flexibility to adapt to evolving market conditions and emerging threats.

Required Information:

User-defined parameters for rule creation
Arithmetic operations for threshold setting

8	Replay Service:

A Replay Service is responsible for retrieving historical data and replaying it through the alerting algorithms. This service should operate independently and doesn't interfere with real-time monitoring. This will be a standalone service that will be triggered on demand when there is need to run surveillance on historical data.


9	User Interface

9.1	 Alert Management

Alert Management serves as a central hub for overseeing and addressing surveillance alerts efficiently.

•	Alert Display: All alerts are listed with unique IDs, associated workflows (such as open, in progress, resolved), timestamps indicating when the ticket was opened, and tracking by age to prioritize based on urgency.
•	Workflow Management: Alerts follow a workflow of statuses including open, in progress, and closed. Users can transition alerts through these statuses directly from the UI, ensuring timely handling and tracking of each alert.
•	Audit Trail for Alerts: A robust audit trail records every action taken on alerts, including configuration changes, acknowledgments, and interventions. Each entry is logged with a timestamp, providing transparency and accountability in alert management.

9.2	 Case Management

Case Management facilitates the structured handling and resolution of alerts triggered by the surveillance system. Additionally, it supports the management of regulatory matters, which can be associated with multiple alerts and have their own workflow.

•	Alert Ticket Creation Workflow: Automatic case creation upon alert generation, integration of alert details into the case, and provision for user input to provide context for investigation.

•	Matter Creation and Association: Users can create regulatory matters within the system and associate them with multiple alerts. Matters serve as overarching entities to manage related alerts and have their own workflow for tracking and resolution.

•	Case Ticket Fields: Essential fields such as status, assigned to, severity, and matter ID categorize and prioritize cases effectively.

•	Case Management UI Features: List view for easy access to open and closed cases, filtering and sorting options for quick identification, workflow actions for status updates and escalations, seamless integration with the alert system and matter management, and reporting capabilities for compliance and analysis.

•	Workflow for Case Management: Cases follow a workflow of statuses including open, in progress, supervisor review, and closed. This structured approach ensures that cases and associated matters are systematically reviewed and resolved, with opportunities for supervisor review to ensure quality and accuracy.

•	Audit Trail for Cases and Matters: Like alerts, all actions related to case and matter management, including status changes, resolutions, and updates, are logged in an audit trail. This comprehensive record ensures transparency and compliance with regulatory standards.

9.3	 Supervisor View

The supervisor view provides a comprehensive dashboard and reporting functionality for overseeing surveillance activities and generating custom reports.

•	Dashboard Overview: A customizable dashboard displaying key statistics and metrics related to alerts and case management. Supervisors can monitor alert statuses, case progress, and other relevant data at a glance.
•	Alert Statistics: Graphical representations and numerical summaries of alert volumes, distribution by severity, age tracking, and workflow statuses.
•	Case Status Monitoring: Visual indicators and summaries of case statuses, including open, in progress, and closed cases. Supervisors can quickly assess the overall status of surveillance investigations.
•	Custom Report Generation: Built-in tools for generating custom reports based on data stored in the system. Supervisors can specify parameters, filters, and formatting options to create reports tailored to their needs.
•	Access Control: Role-based access control ensures that only authorized supervisors have access to the supervisor view. This safeguards sensitive surveillance data and ensures compliance with privacy regulations.


10	Benchmarking

Benchmarking is a dynamic and essential component of Surveillance System, enabling it to adapt to changing market conditions and ensuring the timely identification of suspicious activities. It involves the establishment of threshold values for various parameters by analyzing historical data using statistical methods. The primary goal of benchmarking is to identify fair benchmarks to surveil trading system.

The system employs several benchmarking methods, including Standard Deviation, Distribution Cut-off, and Threshold Table, to determine thresholds for issuing alerts.

•	[10.1] Benchmark parameters are periodically updated in the system's database.
•	[10.2] Alert thresholds are calculated based on the selected benchmarking method for each specific alert type.
•	[10.3] Calculated thresholds are then used to trigger alerts for potential market abuse or irregularities.
