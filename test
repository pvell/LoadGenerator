In order to facilitate price discovery, we want to allow RetailLiquidityProvider orders to cross with non-RetailLiquidityProvider orders. This is because sometimes market makers mau quote at a skew from each other and/or institutional orders may be better than RetailLiquidityProvider orders or vice versa.
