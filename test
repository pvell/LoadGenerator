Certainly! In the context of the provided information, benchmarking is a crucial process within the Trade and Order Surveillance System. It involves the establishment of threshold values for various alerts by analyzing historical data using statistical methods. The primary goal of benchmarking is to identify and flag potential anomalies or irregularities in the financial markets.

Key Aspects of Benchmarking:

Purpose:

Benchmarking is undertaken to set criteria for identifying unusual behavior or events in financial markets through predefined alerts.
Methods:

The system employs several benchmarking methods, including Standard Deviation, Distribution Cut-off, and Threshold Table, to determine thresholds for issuing alerts.
Standard Deviation Mechanism:

This method calculates statistical mean and standard deviation for individual instruments over a sample period.
Thresholds are established based on a user-defined number of standard deviations and a multiplier.
Distribution Cut-off:

This method collects distributions for individual instruments and applies a user-defined distribution percentile cut-off value to determine thresholds.
Threshold Table:

In cases with fewer than 30 observations during benchmarking, thresholds are retrieved from a predefined table based on price ranges.
Absolute Price and Price Percentage Thresholds:

These thresholds are calculated based on the absolute difference or percentage change between trade-to-trade prices.
For observation counts greater than 30, statistical mean and standard deviation are used.
For counts less than 30, thresholds are established using a fallback table or price percentage together with the close price.
Implementation:

Benchmark parameters are periodically updated in the system's database.
Alert thresholds are calculated based on the selected benchmarking method for each specific alert type.
Calculated thresholds are then used to trigger alerts for potential market abuse or irregularities in real-time.
Benchmarking is a dynamic and essential component of the Trade and Order Surveillance System, enabling it to adapt to changing market conditions and ensuring the timely identification of suspicious activities.
