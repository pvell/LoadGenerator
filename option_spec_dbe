Overview
MEMO SBE Options is a binary protocol used by members to submit orders to the MEMX exchange.
Architecture
A MEMO SBE Options session is a sequenced messaging protocol that uses fixed width binary messages.
The MEMO SBE Options wire format uses an SBE-encoded subset of FIX 5.0 SP2 tags and messages.
More information about the FIX protocol and associated tag numbers can be found on the Financial Information Exchange (FIX) Protocol version 5.0 Service Pack 2 page.
MEMO SBE Options messages are transported using the MEMX-TCP protocol to provide reliable ordered transmission of messages between clients and servers.  Connected clients should always use the streaming mode of MEMX-TCP.
Making MEMX-TCP requests for message replay will result in the client being disconnected, as per the MEMX-TCP specification.  Heartbeat and heartbeat timeout intervals for a MEMO connection may be configured via the MEMO port support request process.
Encoding
The MEMO SBE Options protocol uses the FIX Trading Community's Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) to specify message encoding.  More information about SBE can be found at the FIX SBE XML Primer.
MEMO SBE Options is always encoded in Big Endian byte order.
In order to support clients with hardware word alignment restrictions, MEMO SBE will allow clients to supply up to 7 extra bytes after the content of the SBE message. These extra bytes should be added in the MEMX-TCP framing protocol's message length prefix, and not in the message's SBE header.
SBE Data Types
All encoding and decoding for SBE is centered around a set of basic primitive types.
For more information on primitive type encoding, see the SBE specification.
Type	Length (bytes)	Description	Value Range	Null Value	Null Value (Hex)
CHAR	1	ASCII Character	32 to 126 (printable ASCII)	0	0x00
BOOLEAN	1	Boolean value (true or false)	0 to 1
0 = false
1 = true	255	0xFF
INT8	1	Signed Integer	-127 to 127	-128 	0x80
INT16	2	Signed Integer	-32767 to 32767	-32768	0x8000
INT32	4	Signed Integer	-2^31 + 1 to 2^31 - 1	-2^31	0x80000000
INT64	8	Signed Integer	-2^63 + 1 to 2^63 - 1	-2^63	0x8000000000000000
UINT8	1	Unsigned Integer	0 to 254	255	0xFF
UINT16	2	Unsigned Integer	0 to 65534	65535	0xFFFF
UINT32	4	Unsigned Integer	0 to 2^32-2	2^32 - 1	0xFFFFFFFF
UINT64	8	Unsigned Integer	0 to 2^63 - 1	2^64 - 1	0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

The MEMO specification does not use the SBE floating point data types.
PriceType
Some prices are encoded as a fixed-point scaled decimal, consisting of an unsigned long (UINT64) mantissa and a constant exponent of -8.
Type Name	Length	Type	Description
Mantissa	8	UINT64
The fixed-point decimal representation of the price.
Exponent	N/A	INT8
MEMO uses a constant exponent of -8 for all prices.
For example, a mantissa of 123456789 (0x75BCD15) with the constant exponent of -8 represents the decimal number 1.23456789, and would appear encoded on the wire as the hex value 00000000075BCD15.
ShortPriceType
To conserve bytes on the wire, some prices are encoded as a fixed-point scaled decimal, consisting of an unsigned short (UINT16) mantissa and a constant exponent of -2.
Type Name	Length	Type	Description
Mantissa	2	UINT16
The fixed-point decimal representation of the price.
Exponent	N/A	INT8
MEMO uses a constant exponent of -2 for all short prices.
For example, a mantissa of 12345 with the constant exponent of -2 represents the decimal number 123.45, and would appear encoded on the wire as the hex value 00003039
ClOrdID
All ClOrdIDs can be up to 20 characters. They can contain only ASCII printable characters.
Symbology 
Upon request via a separate channel, the exchange provides a list of instrument directory messages. Each instrument directory message provides these relevant field used to identify a product for order processing:
•	OptionsSecurityID, (custom tag 21035) an 8 CHAR field that uniquely identifies an options security on the exchange,
The MEMO for Options SBE protocol uses the OptionsSecurityID (custom tag 21035) in the order related and quote related messages to identify the option security for the message. 
UTCTimestampNanos
Fields with the UTCTimestampNanos type represent a timestamp in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which began on the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC).  UTCTimestampNanos has the time unit of nanoseconds and is encoded as follows:
Type Name	Length	Type	Description
Time	8	UINT64
UTC timestamp since UNIX epoch with nanosecond precision.
Unit	N/A	UINT8
Unit of time.  UTCTimestampNanos are represented in nanoseconds. This field is constant (value=9) and as such will not be transferred on the wire.
SBE Header
SBE includes a header for each message. The SBE header is followed by the SBE body for the message.
The SBE message header contains the fields that allows the decoder to identify what codec should be used for a message.
1.	blockLength: The length of the message. Note: this does not include the header length.
2.	templateID: The identifier for the template type of the message that is to follow.
3.	schemaID: The identifier for the schema the message belongs to.
4.	version: The version of the schema allowing for extension. MEMX packs two pieces of information into the (UINT16) version field, a major version and a minor update version. So for example a version of 258 = 0x0102 indicates major version 1, minor update 2.
5.	numGroups: A count of repeating groups at the root level of the message. The count does not include nested repeating groups.
The MEMO SBE header appears on the wire as:
Field	Offset	Length	Type	Description
BlockLength	0	2	UINT16
The number of bytes in the message body (does not include the header bytes). Note that MEMO messages do not use repeating groups or variable-length fields.
TemplateID	2	1	UINT8
Identifier of the message template (ie. the message type)
SchemaID	3	1	UINT8
The identifier of a message schema. SchemaID=9 for MEMO for US Options
Version	4	2	UINT16
The version number of the message schema that was used to encode a message. MEMX packs two pieces of information into the UNIT16 version field, a major version and a minor update version. So for example a version of 258 = 0x0102 indicates major version 1, minor update 2.
NumGroups	6	1	UINT8
A count of repeating groups at the root level of the message. The count does not include nested repeating groups.
Repeating Groups
RepeatingGroupDimensions Field
Some messages in this specification use repeating groups of fields. A RepeatingGroupDimensions block is inserted prior to each repeating group and contains:
1.	The BlockLength representing the total space reserved for a single repeating group entry (not counting any nested repeating groups or variable-length fields). BlockLength only represents message body fields; it does not include the length of the group dimension itself, which is fixed size.
2.	A counter representing the number of entries in a repeating group.
Type Name	Length	Type	Description
BlockLength	1	UINT8
The total space reserved for a single repeating group entry.
NumInGroup	1	UINT8
A counter representing the number of entries in a repeating group.
